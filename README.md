# WPF Game Of Life

A quick and dirty implementation of Conway's Game of Life using MVVM in WPF. Nothing spectacular, but just enough to see if I could do it. 
Many improvements to be made
a) improved UI
b) interesting starting conditions instead of just manually clicking to create the starting pattern
c) performance improvements.
